This is the most basic and first one, 
I'm working on Iris Flower Classification model using Linear and Non-Linear machine learning algorithms.
Although the dataset is quite small but still I have tried to show the results of both the algorithms which had 
the highest accuracy oout of all the algorithms that I tried.
