# Machine-Learning-Projects
This is a repository that I have made to store all the machine learning projects that I am going to work on.

I'll be uploading the models in two separate files, One will be a .py file containing the whole sourcecode and other will be a jupyter notebook showing the results and comparisons and the description of the dataset as well.
